# Phase 1 Complete ✅

**Date**: October 26, 2025

## Summary

Phase 1 (Fix Existing Quantities) has been successfully completed. All existing go-units quantity files now have complete Revit symbol coverage.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. pressure_units.go ✅
- Verified FootH2O with symbol "FT"
- Verified InchesOfWater with symbol "in-wg"
- Verified MH2O (meter of water column) with symbol "mH2O"
- Verified MilliMH2O (millimeter of water column) with symbol "mmH2O"
- Verified PoundForcePerSquareInchGauge with symbol "psig"
- All conversions accurate

### 2. electrical_resistance_units.go ✅ NEW
- **Added**: ElectricalResistivity quantity
- **Added**: OhmMeter unit with symbol "ohm·m"
- **Added**: Alias "ohm-meter"
- This is a new quantity supporting Revit's electrical resistivity requirements

### 3. frequency_units.go ✅
- Verified Hertz has alias "cps" (cycles per second)
- Verified Hertz has alias "cycles/second"
- Symbol "cps" already present

### 4. length_units.go ✅
- Verified DeciMeter exists (via Deci(Meter) prefix)
- Verified USSurveyFoot with symbol "USft"
- Conversion accurate: 1200.0/3937.0 meters

### 5. power_units.go ✅
- Verified all Revit power units present:
  - Btu/h (British thermal unit per hour)
  - Btu/s (British thermal unit per second)
  - cal/s (calorie per second)
  - hp (horsepower)
  - kcal/s (kilocalorie per second)
  - MBH (thousand British thermal units per hour)
- All conversions validated

### 6. energy_units.go ✅
- Verified Btu (British thermal unit)
- Verified therm
- KiloCalorie already exists via Kilo(Calorie)

## Test Results

```
go test ./...
```

**Result**: All tests passing ✅
- Zero compilation errors
- Zero test failures
- Zero duplicate symbols

## Metrics Update

| Metric | Before Phase 1 | After Phase 1 | Change |
|--------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Quantities | 22 | 23 | +1 (resistivity) |
| Units | ~200 | ~201 | +1 |
| Files Updated | 6 | 7 | +1 |
| Phase 1 Tasks | 0% | 100% | ✅ Complete |

## New Unit Added

**ElectricalResistivity / OhmMeter**
- Quantity: electrical resistivity
- Symbol: ohm·m
- Name: ohm meter
- Alias: ohm-meter
- Use case: Revit electrical resistivity calculations

## Files Modified in Phase 1

1. ✅ pressure_units.go (verified only)
2. ✅ electrical_resistance_units.go (added resistivity)
3. ✅ frequency_units.go (verified only)
4. ✅ length_units.go (verified only)
5. ✅ power_units.go (verified only)
6. ✅ energy_units.go (verified only)
7. ✅ PROGRESS_TRACKER.md (marked complete)
8. ✅ STATUS.md (updated status)

## Documentation Updated

- ✅ PROGRESS_TRACKER.md - All Phase 1 checkboxes marked complete
- ✅ STATUS.md - Updated to reflect Phase 1 completion
- ✅ Removed all time estimates from documentation files

## Next Phase

**Phase 2: High-Priority New Quantities**

Create 8 new quantity files:
1. lighting_units.go (illuminance, luminance, luminous flux, luminous intensity, efficacy)
2. velocity_units.go
3. acceleration_units.go
4. angular_speed_units.go
5. cooling_load_units.go
6. heating_load_units.go
7. moment_of_inertia_units.go
8. stress_units.go

## Summary

Phase 1 focused on ensuring existing quantities have complete Revit coverage. The main accomplishment was adding electrical resistivity support and verifying all previously added units are properly configured.

**Status**: ✅ Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Phase 2
